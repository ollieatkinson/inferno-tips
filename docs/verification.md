# Verification — 18 September 2026

- `npm test`: 47 passing tests. Includes all 20 intended drill techniques, independent attack schedules, all four blob scan phases, bad two-tick alignment, conservation false positives, mitigation exposure, Jad check delay, finite supplies and saved progress.
- `npm run test:production`: static Astro build/check passed with no diagnostics; all 32 Playwright tests passed against the built preview. Every drill completed through the visible controls. Coverage includes mistakes, mastery persistence, corrupt/blocked storage, mouse prayer toggles, saved tab keys, knowledge checks, filters, mobile layout and pause behaviour.
- Real-clock production run completed 36 ticks plus count-in in approximately 23.9 seconds. Other timing tests use a controlled browser clock to check specific boundaries without flaky mouse scheduling.
- `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`: zero vulnerabilities.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

## Chrome DevTools session

Used the official Chrome DevTools MCP in an isolated Chromium session. The preconfigured connection closed its target; an isolated MCP server made the same DevTools tools available without changing user configuration.

- Clicked through Learning path and tested an incorrect knowledge answer followed by the correct answer.
- Inspected the desktop chapter layout and the persistent, prominent LoS link.
- Played the two-tick repair drill at wall-clock speed through DOM button clicks driven by DevTools, without advancing a fake clock or editing engine state. Used the old phase for the first 12 ticks, then the corrected hold: 81%, 34/42 checks correct, ending with a 28-check clean streak. Both early blob attacks were reported as exposed; later attacks were protected.
- Resized to 390 × 844 and inspected the mager trainer: prayer controls remained visible with the tick bar and attack countdown, with no horizontal page overflow.
- Tested the built production phase lab: two-tick M/M/R/R with the second-tick blob read showed 0/2 protected; shifting to M/R/R/M showed 2/2. Reviewed screenshots on mobile and desktop. The mobile table scrolls inside its container.
- Checked the production browser console: no warnings or errors.

A production-only saved-tab-key race was found and fixed: keys are read on trainer creation and the key listener is attached before paint. The final full production suite includes the reload-and-immediate-key test and passes.

Screenshots and raw DevTools output are temporary verification artifacts, not shipped game assets. The app remains a timing/decision trainer: exact game animation recognition, full pathfinding, damage, HP/stat arithmetic and Zuk shield simulation are practised in the linked companion tools.
